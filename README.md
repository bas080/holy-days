A project for trying out the Nuxt.js project.

The goal is to see how routing works and how server side and client side
rendering is merged into a "seamless" programming experience.

After trying it for a bit it does seem to have the features I look for in
a server side rendering and SPA framework. It does however require a good
understanding of what happens where (server or client). Cool ideas tied up into
a neat tool that introduces people to new ways of thinking about web
development.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
